- Fixed hover windows opening under the mouse, causing immediate flickering
- Fixed moving DM screen tabbed panels to empty spaces
- Fixed emptying tabbed DM screen panels containing YouTube/Twitch/dice roller widgets

- Fixed name/encounter gen

- Overhauled the Filter UI. Lots of small changes, a couple of reasonably big changes; you'll see.
- Filters now remember their shown/hidden state between refreshes
- Group filters can now be toggled AND/OR across the group, instead of having a locked hidden default. This, too, should be saved between refreshes. More buttons

- Changed the way links to pre-filtered lists work, to be more consistent
  - [@filter tags now default unspecified filters to "white" mode, instead of using the current values]

			txt: `
- Added version 0.1 of the current (2nd-) highest-voted suggestion (the highest being the Character Creator: "After 2.0's Done™")--the ability to scale creatures by CR. Currently, a small button next to the CR on statblocks in the Bestiary. DM Screen/Roll20/etc integration to come Soon™, mainly because I have to unfuck this Roll20 script/do the UA. Highly experimental, please do screw around with it, and see what's lacking. Things I know to be shit:
  - Doesn't respect enchanted armor
  - Can give people armor with greater Strength requirements than they can wield
  - Completely untested vs Homebrew
  - Doesn't scale spellcasters brilliantly (although I reckon it's passable; feedback appreciated).
  Besides these known issues, it's generally never going to be perfect, so don't expect it to ever be. We're aiming for "functionally good enough," here.

- Added optional "Close Tab?" confirmation to DM Screen (option is in the sidebar)
- Fixed various issues with Bestiary Proficiency Dice toggler
- Minor Statblock Converter improvements

- Made "Recharge X-Y" click/rollable
- Fixed missing vulnerabilities on Objects
- Randomising a subclass can no longer randomise the already-selected subclass
- Added /clear command to Dice Roller
- Fixed various issues with local homebrew loading
- Exporting a filter link now includes only the non-defaulted filters, so the links are much smaller
- Added f and SHIFT-f as hotkeys to place the cursor in search boxes; list search and omnisearch respectively
- Added "Previous"/"Next"/"Back to Top" buttons to bottom of book pages
- Classes page now filters homebrew sources as own distinct type
- Dice Roller placeholder text now contains "drop lowest/highest" examples
- Bestiary print view defaults to printing the current creature if none are sublisted
- Fixed Items page sublist sorting in browsers using , as a decimal separator
- Added @diety tag

The logic is (a1 & a2 & ... aN) & (o1 | o2 | ... oN) where as are set to AND, and os are set to OR. Y'get me?
